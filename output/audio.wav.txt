[ 00:00:00.000 -->  00:00:05.500] SPEAKER_01 Are we a human being becoming stupid? Are we slaves? Is this the modern life?
[ 00:00:05.700 -->  00:00:10.900] SPEAKER_02 Life has become so much better because of a phone. The solution is only consciousness. There is no other way.
[ 00:00:11.700 -->  00:00:28.400] SPEAKER_00 In an era of democratization of technology, innovation, smartphone, internet, social media,we are becoming more and more dependent on all of those tools. I am one of them.They are as important today as food, as water, as breath, as air.
[ 00:00:30.000 -->  00:00:40.400] SPEAKER_01 I am sorry for the question. Are we a human being becoming stupid? Are we slaves?Is this the modern life, modern life slavery for you?
[ 00:00:41.000 -->  00:01:56.600] SPEAKER_02 No, I don't see it that way. Even if you were a caveman, you would carry a stick in your hand.You would never keep the stick down because it was necessary.Maybe there was a snake, maybe there was an animal, maybe there was something else.Always a stick. Today you are carrying a cell phone. I don't see any difference.That stick was useful at that time. This phone is useful now.Now, this is technology which has enabled us to do so many things.I remember twenty-five years ago, thirty years ago, when I was building the foundation,you know, I had to go into those booths with a black phone and make hundred, two hundred calls at a time.Today, if I just think about it, my phone calls, all right?If I say a word, it lands.It will call who I want and it's done.So, life has become so much better because of a phone.But now, people are in a state of compulsiveness.Anything you give, they are so compulsive, they make it into suffering.Compulsive eating, compulsive drinking, compulsive everything.So, the problem is not phone, problem is not something else.Compulsiveness is the problem. The solution is only consciousness. There is no other way.
[ 00:01:56.600 -->  00:01:58.700] SPEAKER_00 And controlling our self.
[ 00:01:58.700 -->  00:02:05.300] SPEAKER_02 No, not controlling.Becoming conscious.If you become conscious, you are liberated, not controlled.
